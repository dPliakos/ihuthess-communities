In the interest of having open and welcoming environment, we are making our best to ensure a smooth and inclusive experience for everyone.

We ask you to be polite and respectful with the people who are contact your community,
be open to different viewpoints, accept constructive criticism or rejection from the list  gracefully and show empathy towards other communities

We will not act as patrolling entity for the communities actions and behavior nor we will take responsibility of other communities' actions. Our goal is to promote our university's communities and we will do it in a honest-by-default fashion.

In case that someone believes that a community should not be listed for code of conduct violation, please open an issue about it and let the rest of us know. Right now there is no plan for action, but we will do our best to find the optimal solution.

If you want your community to be excluded from the list, let us know. We will contact you back and after making sure about the validity of the request we will remove the entry.

Any personal or contact information* about other person than the reporter will be deleted asap. Depending on the case further actions may take place.

Personal targeting and hate speech are not acceptable.Arguments between communities are not welcome.

\* That rule excludes the main contact information of the community
